# Cyber-Security---Network-Intrusions-Detection

**Overview**

Business Context:

We are in a time where businesses are more digitally advanced than ever, and as technology
improves, organizations’ security postures must be enhanced as well. Failure to do so could result in
a costly data breach, as we’ve seen happen with many businesses. The cybercrime landscape has
evolved, and threat actors are going after any type of organization, so in order to protect your
business’s data, money and reputation, it is critical that you invest in an advanced security system.


Business Objective:

With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of
applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly more important. All the
computer systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both technically difficult and
economically costly to be solved by the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is
becoming more important.

The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misusebased detection techniques for a long time. While misuse-based detection is generally favoured in
commercial products due to its predictability and high accuracy, in academic research anomaly
detection is typically conceived as a more powerful method due to its theoretical potential for
addressing novel attacks.

As part of this project, your task is to build network intrusion detection system to detect anomalies
and attacks in the network.

There are two problems:

Binomial classification: Detect anomalies by predicting Activity is normal or attack

Multinomial Classification: Detecting type of activity by predicting Activity is Normal or Back or
Buffer Over flow or FTP Write or Guess Password or Neptune or N-Map or Port Sweep or Root Kit or
Satan or Smurf
